# Native Permission Dialog Always Shown

## Overview
The native location permission dialog now **always shows** whenever location is off, denied, or needs permission. The dialog will appear on both Home Screen and Station Screen automatically.

## Key Implementation

### ✅ Always Shows Native Dialog
- Checks location permission status on app start
- If NOT granted → Shows native permission dialog immediately
- Works on both Home Screen and Station Screen
- Dialog appears automatically without user action

### ✅ Smart Detection
The system checks:
1. **Location Services Enabled** on device
2. **App Permission Status** (granted/denied/denied forever)

**If ANY of these are false:**
- Shows native permission dialog
- User can grant permission directly
- No navigation to settings required

### ✅ Location Status Detection

```
App Opens
↓
Check Location Services Enabled?
  ├─ NO → Show Native Dialog
  └─ YES ↓
      Check App Permission?
        ├─ NOT Granted → Show Native Dialog
        └─ Granted → Load Location ✅
```

## Implementation Details

### Modified: `lib/controllers/navigation_controller.dart`

**Enhanced `requestLocationPermission()` Method:**
```dart
// First check if location services are enabled
bool serviceEnabled = await Geolocator.isLocationServiceEnabled();
if (!serviceEnabled) {
  debugPrint('Location services are disabled');
  return false;
}

// Always request permission to show native dialog
// Even if denied or denied forever, try to request
debugPrint('Requesting location permission...');
permission = await Geolocator.requestPermission();
```

### Modified: `lib/presentation/home/home_page.dart`

**Always Requests Permission:**
```dart
if (status != granted && !_isPermissionDialogShown) {
  _isPermissionDialogShown = true;
  
  // Always request permission to show native dialog
  debugPrint('Requesting location permission...');
  await _navigationController.requestLocationPermission();
}
```

### Modified: `lib/presentation/station/station_screen.dart`

**Same Logic as Home Screen:**
```dart
if (status != granted && !_isPermissionDialogShown) {
  _isPermissionDialogShown = true;
  
  // Always request permission to show native dialog
  debugPrint('Requesting location permission...');
  await _navigationController.requestLocationPermission();
}
```

## Behavior

### Scenario 1: Location Services Disabled
```
1. App Opens
2. Checks location services → DISABLED
3. Native Permission Dialog Appears
4. User can enable location directly
5. On grant → Location loads automatically ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Permission Denied
```
1. App Opens
2. Checks permission → DENIED
3. Native Permission Dialog Appears
4. User selects "While using the app"
5. Permission granted → Location loads ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Permission Denied Forever
```
1. App Opens
2. Checks permission → DENIED FOREVER
3. Native Permission Dialog Appears (if system allows)
4. User can grant permission
5. On grant → Location loads ✅
```

### Scenario 4: Permission Granted
```
1. App Opens
2. Checks permission → GRANTED
3. No dialog shown
4. Location loads silently ✅
```

## Features

### ✅ Automatic Detection
- Checks on app start
- Checks when screen becomes visible
- Checks when app resumes from background

### ✅ Always Shows Dialog
- No special conditions
- If permission not granted → Show dialog
- Simple and predictable

### ✅ Works on All Screens
- Home Screen
- Station Screen
- Both use same logic

### ✅ No Manual Trigger Needed
- No button to press
- No extra step
- Automatic and seamless

## User Experience

### iOS Flow
```
User Opens App
↓
"Allow swapandgo to access this device's location?"
  [While using the app]
  [Only this time]
  [Don't allow]
↓
User Selects "While using the app"
↓
Permission Granted
↓
Location Loads
↓
Map Shows User Location ✅
```

### Android Flow
```
User Opens App
↓
"Allow swapandgo to access your location?"
  [Allow]  [Don't allow]
↓
User Selects "Allow"
↓
Permission Granted
↓
Location Loads
↓
Map Shows User Location ✅
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Simple & Predictable
- One rule: If not granted → Show dialog
- No complex conditions
- Easy to understand

### ✅ Always Works
- Handles all permission states
- Never misses showing dialog
- Reliable behavior

### ✅ Better UX
- User knows immediately what to do
- No confusion
- Clear path to enable location

### ✅ Automatic
- No manual steps needed
- Dialog appears by itself
- Seamless experience

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Fresh Install
1. Install app for first time
2. Open app
3. **Native dialog appears immediately** ✅
4. Grant permission
5. Location loads

### Test Case 2: Permission Denied
1. Deny permission previously
2. Open app
3. **Native dialog appears** ✅
4. Grant permission
5. Location loads

### Test Case 3: Location Services OFF
1. Turn off location services
2. Open app
3. **Native dialog appears** (if system allows) ✅
4. User can still grant permission

### Test Case 4: Permission Already Granted
1. Permission already granted
2. Open app
3. **No dialog** ✅
4. Location loads silently

## Debug Logging

The implementation includes debug logging:
```
Current location permission status: denied
Requesting location permission...
Permission result: whileInUse
```

This helps track permission flow during development.

## Summary

✅ **Native dialog always shows** when permission not granted  
✅ **Works on Home and Station screens**  
✅ **Automatic detection** of location status  
✅ **No manual trigger needed**  
✅ **Simple and reliable** behavior  
✅ **Better user experience**  

The native permission dialog will now always appear whenever location is needed but permission is not granted, providing users with a clear and immediate way to enable location access.
